## Process
### Step 1: [Setup your REACT Native Environment]
- Assuming that you have [Node 12 LTS] or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
- After install the tools, next is to start first project
```
expo init FirstProject
```
```
cd FirstProject
```
```
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```
- Running your React Native application
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the Camera app.

### Step 2: Go through [REACT native Tutorial]
- In accordance with the ancient traditions of our people, we must first build an app that does nothing except say "Hello, world!". Here it is:
